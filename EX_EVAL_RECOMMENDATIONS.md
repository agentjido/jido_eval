### Expanded Recommendations from `ex_eval` for `jido_eval`

Here is an expanded version of each recommended improvement, with more details on implementation, benefits, and examples drawn from `ex_eval`'s design. These focus on enhancing extensibility, reliability, and Elixir-native features while keeping the Ragas-inspired API intact. Integrate them selectively in Phases 4-7 of your plan.

- **Adopt Pluggable Architecture**: Implement behaviors for core components like metrics (already planned), reporters (for output formatting, e.g., console or JSON), stores (for persisting results, e.g., to databases), broadcasters (for events), processors (pre/response/post for data transformation, e.g., input normalization or output refinement), and middleware (for cross-cutting logic like logging or retries). This enables users to swap or extend parts easily via configuration, promoting maintainability and custom workflows. Example from `ex_eval`: `config = ExEval.put_reporter(MyApp.JsonReporter, format: :json)` – adapt this to `Jido.Eval` for flexible reporting without altering the core evaluation function.

- **Adopt Composite Metrics**: Add support for combining multiple metrics or LLMs into composites, such as consensus (e.g., majority vote or threshold agreement) or weighted aggregation, to mitigate LLM variability and produce more reliable scores with metadata like agreement ratios or individual votes. This improves fault tolerance for metrics like faithfulness by averaging across models. Example: `config = ExEval.put_consensus_judge(config, [{Metric1, model: "gpt-4"}, Metric2], strategy: :majority)` – integrate as an optional `CompositeMetric` module in your metric registry for robust scoring in Phase 5.

- **Adopt Real-Time Broadcasting**: Introduce a broadcaster behavior to publish events (e.g., run started, progress updates, completion, failures) in real-time, using tools like Phoenix PubSub or `:telemetry` for monitoring in dashboards or apps. This enhances observability for long-running or distributed evaluations, allowing callbacks or UI integration. Example: `config = ExEval.put_broadcasters(config, [{ExEvalPubSub.Broadcaster, topic: "evals"}])` with events like `{:eval_started, run_id, total_samples}` – add to your OTP engine in Phase 6 for better production monitoring without impacting batch API.

- **Adopt Built-in Metrics Computation**: Automatically compute and include aggregate statistics in results, such as pass rates, latency percentiles (avg, p50, p95, p99), category breakdowns, and experiment metadata (e.g., params, tags for tracking runs like MLflow). This provides deeper insights beyond simple averages, aiding performance tuning and A/B testing. Example: Results struct with `%{pass_rate: 0.70, avg_latency_ms: 245.5, by_category: %{...}}` – extend your `Result` struct in Phase 7 with these computations via `:telemetry` spans for enhanced usability.

- **Adopt Process Registry for Concurrency**: Use a process registry (e.g., via `:pg`, `:registry`, or ETS) to track evaluation runs and workers dynamically, enabling status querying, fault isolation (e.g., restart failed workers), and scalability across nodes. This builds on your OTP supervision for better management of concurrent tasks, like polling run progress. Inferred from `ex_eval`'s fault-tolerant concurrency: Adapt by registering runners under unique IDs in Phase 6's `Exec.Supervisor`, e.g., `Registry.register(ExEval.Registry, run_id, %{pid: self()})`, to support multi-node extensions.
